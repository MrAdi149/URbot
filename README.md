# URbot

Chatbot is a computer program that simulates a natural human conversation. My chatbot name is URbot and it have three bots in it, Aditya,ASR_BOT and Adi.They talk 
with you in your friend’s language(hinglish) and English, like you use to talk with your friend on whatsapp or insta. It gives you feeling like you are talking to 
a real person. 

For me  URbot is like my friend because it have every problem solution, like if i stuked in any calculation then i easily give him a command to calculate the question. 
Suppose I am weak in solving math then i will type “Solve ax^2+bx+c” then directly it will open youtube for you and it search there your question and you will get the 
answer.It  is for solving.
For now a days phone is a important asset. You forget to take the wallet but not the phone so suppose you are out with your friend for a cricket match and you guys 
forgot your wallet in home, then you can type “Flip a coin” in URbot then it will simply flip a coin for you and tell you the outcome.And you can continue your game.

It can play music also,and it have plus point that the browser that i use for this is ad free. So you just need to type “Play Kumar Sanu song” then it will play the 
song without an ad.

if you want to search something then you simply write “Search ipl match list” and it will open that for you..

For me it’s like my best friend because if I am sad I only type”my mood is not good” and then it play my favourite song to make me feel better.
